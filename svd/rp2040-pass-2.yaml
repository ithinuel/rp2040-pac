          description: |
            When this channel completes, it will trigger the channel indicated by CHAIN_TO. Disable by setting CHAIN_TO = _(this channel)_.
            Reset value is 0, which means for channels 1 and above the default will be to chain to channel 0 - set this field to avoid this behaviour.
